# IBMSkillsNetwork: IBM GPXX0KSEEN - Build an Image Style Transfer Tool to Transform Photos to Monet Paintings with CycleGANs🌈🪄 
  Artists like Claude Monet are recognized for the unique styles of their works, such as the unique colour scheme and brush strokes.
  
  These are hard to be imitated by normal people, and even for professional painters, it will not be easy to produce a painting whose 
  
  style is Monet-esque. However, thanks to the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their many variations, Data 
  
  Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can build and train deep learning models to bring an artist's peculiar style to your photos.
  
  In this project, you will be guided through building a style transfer tool using CycleGAN to "translate" the photos in your album 
  
  into paintings that are Monet-esque!
